    <h2>What is ROCA?</h2>
    <p>ROCA is a collection of recommendations for decent Web application frontends. You can read more about it on <a
        href="http://roca-style.org/">roca-style.org</a>.</p>
    <p>This application serves as an example of how the ROCA recommendations can be applied using the <a
        href="http://www.playframework.com/">Play Framework</a>. Each section of this tutorial refers to one of the
    ROCA principles and describes how it is applied in the example application.</p>

    <h2>Unobtrusive JavaScript</h2>
    <p>ROCA applications <a href="http://roca-style.org/#unobtrusive-javascript">use JavaScript unobtrusively</a> and
    remain usable when JavaScript is disabled or just doesn't happen to work. You can see this principle applied on
    the list of issues in the example application.</p>
    <p>When browsing through the list of issues without using JavaScript,
    the entire DOM is refreshed when viewing the next page or filtering for a specific project. If, on the other hand,
    JavaScript is available, only the part of the DOM that has actually changed (the list of issues) is updated.</p>
    <p>Hence, JavaScript is used solely to enhance the user experience, but the functionality (filtering, pagination etc.)
        remains usable if JavaScript doesn't work.</p>
    <p>There is not a lot you need to do in your server-side Play code in order to support this principle.
    All you need to do is serve both full HTML representations of your resources (i.e. the HTML
        includes the surrounding layout) and partial HTML without the surrounding layout.</p>
    <p>The former needs to be served in case of a full page load. If JavaScript is working,
    however, the client can make use of PJAX, updating the DOM with the partial HTML and <a href="http://roca-style.org/#historyapi">using
    the HTML5 History API</a> to update the browser's current URL.</p>
    <p>We make use of a <a href="#code/app/helpers/ConditionalLayout.scala" class="shortcut">custom Play action builder</a>
        in order to provide an enriched request to our controller that holds information on whether
    a full layout is required or not. This is determined based on the presence and value of the
    <code>X-PJAX</code> HTTP request header.</p>
    <p>The <a href="#code/app/controllers/Issues.scala" class="shortcut">Issues controller</a>
    makes use of this to render a different view, depending on whether a layout is required
    or not.</p>
